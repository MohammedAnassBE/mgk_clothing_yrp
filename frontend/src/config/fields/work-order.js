/**
 * Work Order — per-DocType field config consumed by DocDetail.vue.
 *
 * Three concerns:
 *   • `detail`  — curated Details-tab list shown in VIEW mode (mirrors the
 *                 mockup in `custom ui/MGK_WEB.html`; tighter than meta order).
 *   • `formOrder` — exact field order for EDIT / CREATE mode. Mirrors the Desk
 *                 form so naming_series is the first user-facing input.
 *   • `hideFormFields` — fields the user explicitly does not want surfaced in
 *                 the form (e.g. `includes_packing` — packing is computed from
 *                 the Item context on MGK's floor).
 *   • `linkSearchHandlers` — per-Link-field custom search factories. Each
 *                 receives the reactive form object and returns either an async
 *                 `(query) => Array<{ name }>` (when a filter applies) or null
 *                 (fall through to the default name-like search). Used to
 *                 restrict the Address autocomplete to addresses belonging to
 *                 the selected party, the same way the Desk does.

// Fields not present / hidden / read-only-empty are dropped per-group by
