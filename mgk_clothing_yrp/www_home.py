Wired via `get_website_user_home_page` in hooks.py. Frappe calls this for every
logged-in user (see `frappe/website/utils.py::get_home_page_via_hooks`) to pick
their home page.

Policy (MGK_WEB_PLAN.md, resolved 2026-05-25): everyone lands on the custom
`/web` work hub EXCEPT `System Manager` and `Administrator`, who keep the Desk
default. Returning `None` lets Frappe fall through to its normal resolution
(workspace / desk) for those privileged users.
