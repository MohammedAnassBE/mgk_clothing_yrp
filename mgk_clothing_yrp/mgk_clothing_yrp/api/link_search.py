"""Title-aware Link search for the /web SPA.

The SPA's `searchLink` originally queried only the `name` (ID) column
(`frappe.client.get_list` with `name like %txt%`). That breaks for doctypes whose
human-readable label lives in a separate field — e.g. yrp's `Item` is autonamed
`Item-.#####` (so `name` = "Item-00012") while the descriptive name is in
`name1` ("Greige Yarn"). Typing "Greige" matched nothing.

`link_search` mirrors what the Frappe Desk link search does: match the typed text
against `name` AND the doctype's title / search fields, and return both the `name`
(the value a Link stores) and a `label` (what to show the user). It is
meta-driven — it auto-detects the title field from the doctype meta plus a few
yrp/Frappe conventions (`name1`, `item_name`, `<doctype>_name`, `title`) — so it
needs no per-doctype configuration and degrades to a plain name search when there
is no title field.

	`search_fields` are deliberately EXCLUDED here — they broaden matching (below)
	but are often not labels: e.g. Goods Received Note's first search field is
	`against_id`, so using it as the label made every GRN show the WO/PO it was
	received against, which read as "the picker is listing Work Orders, not GRNs".
	When no title field exists, the record's own `name` (e.g. GRN-2026-00008) is
